(The year 1866 was marked by a bizarre development, an unexplained and downright inexplicable) Tj T*
(phenomenon that surely no one has forgotten. Without getting into those rumors that upset civilians) Tj T*
(in the seaports and deranged the public mind even far inland, it must be said that professional) Tj T*
(seamen were especially alarmed. Traders, shipowners, captains of vessels, skippers, and master) Tj T*
(mariners from Europe and America, naval officers from every country, and at their heels the various) Tj T*
(national governments on these two continents, were all extremely disturbed by the business. In) Tj T*
(essence, over a period of time several ships had encountered "an enormous thing" at sea, a long) Tj T*
(spindle-shaped object, sometimes giving off a phosphorescent glow, infinitely bigger and faster ) Tj T*
(than any whale. The relevant data on this apparition, as recorded in various logbooks, agreed ) Tj T*
(pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in question, its unprecedented speed ) Tj T*
(of movement, its startling locomotive power, and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be) Tj T*
(gifted. If it was a cetacean, it exceeded in bulk any whale previously classified by science. No) Tj T*
(naturalist, neither Cuvier nor LacÃ©pÃ¨de, neither Professor Dumeril nor Professor de Quatrefages,) Tj T*
(would have accepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen -- specifically, unseen by their) Tj T*
(own scientific eyes. Striking an average of observations taken at different times -- rejecting ) Tj T*
(those timid estimates that gave the object a length of 200 feet, and ignoring those exaggerated) Tj T*
(views that saw it as a mile wide and three long--you could still assert that this phenomenal) Tj T*
(creature greatly exceeded the dimensions of anything then known to ichthyologists, if it existed at) Tj T*
(all. Now then, it did exist, this was an undeniable fact; and since the human mind dotes on objects) Tj T*
(of wonder, you can understand the worldwide excitement caused by this unearthly apparition. As for) Tj T*
(relegating it to the realm of fiction, that charge had to be dropped. In essence, on July 20, 1866,) Tj T*
(the steamer Governor Higginson, from the Calcutta & Burnach Steam Navigation Co., encountered this) Tj T*
(moving mass five miles off the eastern shores of Australia. Captain Baker at first thought he was ) Tj T*
(in the presence of an unknown reef; he was even about to fix its exact position when two ) Tj T*
(waterspouts shot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some 150 feet. So,) Tj T*
(unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had) Tj T*
(fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal, until then unknown, that could spurt from its) Tj T*
(blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam. Similar events were likewise observed in Pacific) Tj T*
(seas, on July 23 of the same year, by the Christopher Columbus from the West India & Pacific Steam) Tj T*
(Navigation Co. Consequently, this extraordinary cetacean could transfer itself from one locality to) Tj T*
(another with startling swiftness, since within an interval of just three days, the Governor) Tj T*
(Higginson and the Christopher Columbus had observed it at two positions on the charts separated by ) Tj T*
(a distance of more than 700 nautical leagues. Fifteen days later and 2,000 leagues farther, the) Tj T*
(Helvetia from the Compagnie Nationale and the Shannon from the Royal Mail line, running on opposite) Tj T*
(tacks in that part of the Atlantic lying between the United States and Europe, respectively ) Tj T*
(signaled each other that the monster had been sighted in latitude 42 degrees 15' north and ) Tj T*
(longitude 60 degrees 35' west of the meridian of Greenwich. From their simultaneous observations,) Tj T*
(they were able to estimate the mammal's minimum length at more than 350 English feet; this was) Tj T*
(because both the Shannon and the Helvetia were of smaller dimensions, although each measured 100) Tj T*
(meters stem to stern. Now then, the biggest whales, those rorqual whales that frequent the ) Tj T*
(waterways of the Aleutian Islands, have never exceeded a length of 56 meters--if they reach even) Tj T*
(that. One after another, reports arrived that would profoundly affect public opinion: new) Tj T*
(observations taken by the transatlantic liner Pereire, the Inman line's Etna running afoul of the) Tj T*
(monster, an official report drawn up by officers on the French frigate Normandy, dead-earnest) Tj T*
(reckonings obtained by the general staff of Commodore Fitz-James aboard the Lord Clyde. In) Tj T*
(lighthearted countries, people joked about this phenomenon, but such serious, practical countries ) Tj T*
(as England, America, and Germany were deeply concerned. In every big city the monster was the ) Tj T*
(latest rage; they sang about it in the coffee houses, they ridiculed it in the newspapers, they) Tj T*
(dramatized it in the theaters. The tabloids found it a fine opportunity for hatching all sorts of) Tj T*
(hoaxes. In those newspapers short of copy, you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary) Tj T*
(creature, from "Moby Dick," that dreadful white whale from the High Arctic regions, to the) Tj T*
(stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine a 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths.) Tj T*
(They even reprinted reports from ancient times: the views of Aristotle and Pliny accepting the) Tj T*
(existence of such monsters, then the Norwegian stories of Bishop Pontoppidan, the narratives of ) Tj T*
(Paul Egede, and finally the reports of Captain Harrington -- whose good faith is above ) Tj T*
(suspicion--in which he claims he saw, while aboard the Castilian in 1857, one of those enormous) Tj T*
(serpents that, until then, had frequented only the seas of France's old extremist newspaper, The) Tj T*
